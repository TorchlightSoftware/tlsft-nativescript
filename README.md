[Crema App - Web](https://github.com/cremalab/crema-app-web)

# Tools Used

* NativeScript
* How will we test?
* ESLint
* Mocha
* Prettier
* TypeScript

# Setup

Install node dependencies:

```
npm i
```

# Run in Dev

[tns preview](https://docs.nativescript.org/tooling/docs-cli/project/testing/preview#tns-preview) will compile the app, upload it to `https://play.nativescript.org/s/{app-id}`, and render a QR code that you can scan with the NativeScript Playground App.  Playground is just a QR code reader, it will open the app in NativeScript Preview.

```
